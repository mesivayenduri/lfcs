############## List Block Devices and Partitions ####################

-> To see what devices exist on Linux File system
    -> lsblk   (list block devices)


############# Creating Partition ######################

-> All of the block devices are actually referenced as files under /dev directory

-> To see what partitions exist on a block devices
    -> sudo fdisk --list /dev/sda
    note: fdisk can be used to create and delete partitions too.

-> cfdisk also used to create and delete partitions too. ( Little easier to use )
    Eg: sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb


############# SWAP ###################

-> To see if system uses any kind of swap areas.
    -> swapon --show

-> We create a swap file system when patitioning sdb block device.
   To use a partition as a swap area it has to be prepared.
   It basically writes some small header data on the partition and labels it.
   To format a partition as a swap we use below command.
        -> sudo mkswap /dev/sdb3

-> To see more verbose details of a swap partition
    -> sudo swapon --verbose /dev/sdb3

-> Once the swap creation complete we can see the swap ares with below command
    -> swapon --show

Note: If we reboot the system /dev/sdb3 wont be used as a swap anymore becoz the changes we made are temporary.



-> To stop using a partition as swap use below command
    ->sudo swapoff /dev/sdb3

Till now we saw how to use a partition as a swap area. But instead of partitions we also use files as swap.

                        -------- (Output file)    
-> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=128            ( 1M * 128 )
            -----------          ----- (block size)
            Its a special device file that generates an infinite number of zeros when a application reads from it.

-> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=2048 status=progress
-> sudo chmod 600 /swap
-> To make use this a swap are
    ->sudo mkswap /swap

###################### CREATE AND CONFIGURE FILE SYSTEMS ###########################

To store files & diretories in a partition, first we need to create file system on it.
By default Redhad OS uses XFS filesystem. Ubuntu used ext4 filesystem.

These default might change in the future as they have changed in the past.

To Format a partition with XFS filesystem we can use below commands
    -> sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1

To format a partition with EXT4 filesystem we can use below command
    -> sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

To create filesystem and Label it:
    -> sudo mkfs.xfs -L "BackupVolume" /dev/sdb1

To Create filesyste, Assign lable and setting inode size
    -> sudo mkfs.xfs -L "BackupVolume" -i size=512 /dev/sdb1

To force format a partition
    -> sudo mkfs.xfs -f /dev/sdb1

If we type xfs_ and press tab we can see xfs utilities
    -> xfs_admin utility can be used to change things on already created filesystem

    -> to view the label of a partition
        -> sudo xfs_admin -l /dev/sdb1
    -> to change the label of a partition
        -> sudo xfs_admin -L="BKP_Volume" /dev/sdb1

Similary we use use mkfs.ext4
